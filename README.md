# Secure Census System
This repository contains the source code for an academic analysis and implementation of a secure digital census system. It stresses security from the beginning of the design, from user authentication, to data encryption, and audit logging. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework, is used to quickly prototype the project's frontend and backend together in one place. [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) is used for a local database to exemplify how queries should be made to the database securely. Lastly, additional packages are used for other necessary features in a secure app, such as [Joi](https://joi.dev/) for data validation, and more.

## Getting Started

Requirements:
- Node.js 

Steps:
1. from the root directory, use `npm install` to autmatically download all required node modules
2. next use `npm run dev` to launch the dev version of the application (sufficient for demonstration)
3. navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the website live
